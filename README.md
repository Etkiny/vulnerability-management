# Backend Project for Vulnerabilities

## Overview

This project is a backend project for managing vulnerabilities and sending email notifications. Every night the vulnerabilities are fetched from NVD and sent email to users if they have any affected products. It uses Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Node.js (v22)
- npm (v7 or later)
- Docker and Docker Compose

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Etkiny/vulnerability-management
cd vulnerability-management
```
### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```
## LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
### Start PostgreSQL:
Ensure you have a running PostgreSQL instance.
### Run Migrations:
Run database migrations to set up the schema.

```bash
npm npm run migrate
```
### Start the Application:
Start the application.
```bash
npm npm start
```
### Dockerize the Application
To run the application using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
This will start the application at http://localhost:3000 and PostgreSQL at localhost:5432.

## Scripts

The following npm scripts are available:

- npm start: Starts the application using ts-node.
- npm run build: Compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript.
- npm run migrate: Runs the database migrations.
- npm run format: Formats the code using Prettier.
- npm test: Runs tests (currently placeholder).
